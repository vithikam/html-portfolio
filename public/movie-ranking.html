<h1>The Best Movies According to Vithika</h1>
<h2>My Top-3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>This is based on classic novel Pride and Prejudice. I love the novel and the movie takes from the novel nicely.</p>

<h3>The Others</h3>
<p> This movie is in horror genre but the fear element is rarely on the surface; always forming an undertone in the movie. The twist comes as a realisation that connects the rest of the movie.</p>

<h3>Sholay</h3>
<p>This Bollywood Movie is a classic that mixes all the elements romance, drama, action, suspense and comedy to deliver a wholesome 2.5 hrs experience.</p>
